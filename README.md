# EDEN-Script
My own programming language.
This project is meant to build an interpreted using Java for all the interworking parts.
The motivation behind this project as a whole is to deepen my understanding of programming languages as well as familarize myself with the art of Java. 
The language itself is called EDEN script (Ethan Denning, lol i know),
It is meant to be a beginner focused language to help teach kids how to program.

UPDATES TO SYNTAX WILL BE POSTED AT FINAL PROJECT.
Complete documentation is yet to come.
