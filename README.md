# EDEN - Toy Interpreted Language
Eden Is a basic interpreted programming language built on C++. Proper documentation is to be implemented upon completion, however I will include
what is important to know now. 
EDEN --version 1.0 will support: 
  - simple high leevel variable declaration and instantiation of types int, double, bool, string, and char.
  - Basic Control Flow principles
  - Core Arithmatic Operators
  - Functions and Function return types.

As of reading this documentation the lexical analyzer has been implemented; tokenizing user's source code. The parser is now to be 
implemented to parse to abstract syntax tree. I.E ---->
