notes on cmake

See file for my CmakeConfig for this project

when running: 
mkdir build -> user inputted src code goes in here

cmake -S . -B build/ ---> build files written to build directory

cmake --build build/ ---> building... goes to ./build/Debug/eden 

^^^^^^^^^^^ visual studio automatically sends eden executable (eden.exe) to the debug file

so it goes ./build/Debug/(my custom executable) to run the program.

in my case i expect a cmdline argument of whatever the user inputted source code file is.

in my case "test.eden" or any arbitrary file with .eden extension

to run an eden file it goes. 

./build/Debug/eden HelloWorld.eden
